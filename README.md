## For developers
If you want to add a new game, follow this steps:
1. First, open an **issue** indicating the new game you want to implement (obligatory).
2. **Fork** this Repository.
3. Create a **branch** with the name of the game in lowercase where you will must upload all your changes
4. Create a **directory** in games directory with the name of your game
5. Upload a jpg, png or gif of the **game cover** in images directory
6. Create a **pull request** from your branch to the master branch and I will review it
7. Finnaly, I'll take care of creating the link to your game from the main menu :)
